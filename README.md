INTRODUCTION
Hello guys, welcome to my "Workflow" project. This was my attempt at making Microsoft Teams, but web only. I had to limit the amount of features due to timing issues and lack-of-10-years-coding-experience issues aswell. 
But the end product works (at least on my machine :D).
Feel free to do as you wish to the product of 5 months-worth of work from a amateur softwarea developer.
I would actually be so happy if this project helps anyone in any way, please send comments on any ideas you have I seek knowledge and people better than me.
This was my biggest project ever. It was also, to be honest, my first big project. Expect horrendous code. 
But here I am going to attempt to redeem myself by explaining this project as best as I can.
Thank you so much for your interest, and patience!

PROJECT STRUCTURE
The Big Picture
This a web application. It consists of a front-end, a back-end, a database and a websocket server.
  Front-end = Vue.js version 3, with axios library used to make HTTP requests
  Back-end = Flask the python microframework. I used the flask_mysqldb library to deal with SQL statements
  Database = I used MariaDB (relational database)
  Websocket Server = I used the ws packed and attatched it to Node.js's built in HTTP server. Express was used to handle HTTP routes and axios to make HTTP requests.
